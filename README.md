This code allows you to perform brief molecular dynamcs simulations of small samples in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions using chartesian coordinates for ther atoms as inputs (I used VESTA files) together with others inputs: I wrote them in external files because it is a project for an exam in which I wanted to show my ability with reading routines, but the code can be easily modified to include them in the code itself.
Several other improvements can be easily done by using Python powers.
